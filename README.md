## Description

The goal of this project attempts to convert emil's RISC-V implementation from Verilog to SystemVerilog. This project seeks to prove our understanding of SystemVerilog for our Intro to SV graduate course. The RISC-V model in question is a RV32I variant which is the simplicity variant to implement.

## Installation
The individual contributions folder contains separate folders for each member of the group.
In these folders are copies of the files that each person contributed to the project.
A notes file is also included for anyone who worked on/modified other files.

The implementation test folder contains any WIP files. 
If any changes are to be made, the changes will be made to these files. 
This ensures that a working version of the files is maintained, even when changes are being applied. 

The src and tb folders contain the current working versions of the model and testbench respectively.  
NOTE: Some individual module testbenches may no longer work as modifications were made to each module for CPU implementation. 

<!-- Specify what the primary c file is -->
<!-- Potential reorganize repo and divert the other files into an archive folder -->

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
