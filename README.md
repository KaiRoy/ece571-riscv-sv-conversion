# ece571-riscv-sv-conversion
Project attempting to convert  emil's risc-v implementation from verilog to systemverilog
## Repo Structure
The individual contributions folder contains separate folders for each member of the group.
In these folders are copies of the files that each person contributed to the project.
A notes file is also included for anyone who worked on/modified other files.

The implementation test folder contains any WIP files. 
If any changes are to be made, the changes will be made to these files. 
This ensures that a working version of the files is maintained, even when changes are being applied. 

The src and tb folders contain the current working versions of the files. 
NOTE: Some individual module testbenches may no longer work as modifications were made to each module for CPU implementation.
